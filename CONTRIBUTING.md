### Scrape Process

When you add a new scraper for a new website, follow these guidelines:

#### Folder structure

> [!NOTE]
> It's advisable to write the scraper in TypeScript for better type checking.

- `get-all.ts`: Contains the main script to scrape all verses from a given book
  chapter.

- `get-book.ts`: Get all available books from the website.

- `get-paragraph.ts`: Verses should be split into paragraphs to maintain the original
  structure of the text. Like which verses are in the same paragraph in the
  original text.

- `get-psalm-meta.ts`: Get the metadata of a psalm.

- `get-version.ts`: Get all available versions of the Bible from the website.

- `insert-data.ts`: Insert the scraped data into the database using Prisma or any
  other ORM.

- `main.ts`: Contains the main function to run the scraper.

Example structure:

```
src
└── new-domain
    ├── get-all.ts
    ├── get-book.ts
    ├── get-paragraph.ts
    ├── get-psalm-meta.ts
    ├── get-version.ts
    ├── insert-data.ts
    └── main.ts
```

#### Database Schema

- Any breaking changes to the database schema should be discussed before making
  the changes.

- All domains MUST be support new changes to the database schema, to ensure
  consistency across all domains.

- Currently we have two Prisma schema for `pgsql` and `sqlite`, so any changes
  to the schema should be reflected in both schemas.

#### Process Data

> [!NOTE]
> DON'T just focus on verse number to process data, please ensure **the content
> integrity is the first priority**.

Currently, we are extracting contents using regular expressions using
`VerseProcessor` from `lib/verse-utils`.

These conventions are applied as modifying HTML contents before we parsing HTML
into Markdown parser. After that we pass it to `VerseProcessor`.

**Conventions**:

- **Verse numbers**: Wrap the number with `$`. E.g.: `$1$`, `$2$`, etc.
- **Cross references**: Wrap content or characters with `@$`. E.g.: `@$Jn
1:1$@`.
- **Footnotes**: Wrap number or characters with `<$` and `$>`. E.g.: `<$1$>`.
- **Headings**: Non heading elements MUST be replaced with headings elements.
  E.g.: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.
- **Words of Jesus**: Wrap with `b` element. E.g.: `<b>Jesus</b>`.
- **Poetry**: Add `~` at the beginning of the line. E.g.: `~This is a poetry`.
- **Paragraph**: Wrap with `p` element. E.g.: `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also choose new conventions to pass to the `VerseProcessor`.

#### Insert Data

It's advisable that data should be inserted as `upsert` to avoid duplicate data
for **idempotent operation**.

#### Logging

Every steps of the scraping process should be logged to track the process.
